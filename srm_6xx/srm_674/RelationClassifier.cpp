SRM 674 Div2 Easy (250)

PROBLEM STATEMENT
Weiwei is studying math. Unfortunately, math is very hard for him. Today, the teacher asked Weiwei to determine if a relation is a bijection or not.

Formally, a relation is a set of ordered pairs of elements. The teacher gave Weiwei one such relation. You are also given a description of this relation: vector <int>s domain and range. For each valid i, the relation contains the ordered pair (domain[i], range[i]).

Let X be the set of elements that appear at least once in domain. Similarly, let Y be the set of elements that appear at least once in range. We say that an element x of X is paired to an element y of Y if the relation contains the ordered pair (x, y).

We will say that our relation is a bijection if each element of X is paired to exactly one element of Y, and each element of Y is paired to exactly one element of X.

If Weiwei's relation is a bijection, return "Bijection" (quotes for clarity). Otherwise, return "Not". Note that the return value is case-sensitive.


DEFINITION
Class:RelationClassifier
Method:isBijection
Parameters:vector <int>, vector <int>
Returns:string
Method signature:string isBijection(vector <int> domain, vector <int> range)


CONSTRAINTS
-domain will contain between 1 and 10 elements, inclusive.
-range will contain the same number of elements as domain.
-Each element of domain and range will be between 1 and 100, inclusive.
-No two pairs (domain[i], range[i]) will be identical.


EXAMPLES

0)
{1, 1}
{2, 3}

Returns: "Not"

Since 1 in X is paired with both 2 and 3 in Y, the given relation is not a bijection.


1)
{4, 5}
{2, 2}

Returns: "Not"

Since both 4 and 5 in X are paired with 2 in Y, the given relation is not a bijection.


2)
{1}
{2}

Returns: "Bijection"

A single ordered pair is always a bijection.


3)
{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

Returns: "Bijection"


4)
{14, 12, 10, 13, 20, 18, 9, 17, 14, 9}
{18, 6, 8, 15, 2, 14, 10, 13, 13, 15}

Returns: "Not"
