SRM 766 Div1 Easy (250)

PROBLEM STATEMENT

An ice hockey playoff final is played as a sequence of matches.
The winner is the first team that wins winsNeeded of those matches.

Teams A and B are facing off in such a final.
The home ice alternates every two matches.
That is, A plays the first two matches on their home ice, B plays matches 3 and 4 on their home ice, A plays matches 5 and 6 at home, and so on.

It is known that home and away games are completely different. In this matchup, we know the following about a single independent game between A and B:

If A plays at home ice, they win with probability AwinHome percent.
If B plays at home ice, they win with probability BwinHome percent.

There is a reason why we emphasized the words "single independent game" in the previous paragraph.
In a playoff series there is one more factor that influences the win probability of each team: momentum.
The team that keeps winning has a morale boost that makes it more likely that they will win the next match.
In this problem, momentum works as follows:
if a team has a streak of W won matches in a row, their win probability for the next match is increased by 5*W percent (up to a maximum of 100 percent, of course).

For example, if A won the first game of the series and B won the next three, in game five B has a 5*3 = 15 percent boost due to momentum.

You are given winsNeeded, AwinHome and BwinHome.
Let P be the probability that team A will win the whole series.
Let M = 2*winsNeeded-1 be the maximum number of matches in the series.
It can be shown that X = P * 100^M is an integer.
Compute and return the value (X modulo (10^9 + 7)).


DEFINITION
Class:HockeyPlayoff
Method:winProbability
Parameters:int, int, int
Returns:int
Method signature:int winProbability(int winsNeeded, int AwinHome, int BwinHome)


CONSTRAINTS
-winsNeeded will be between 1 and 600, inclusive.
-AwinHome will be between 0 and 100, inclusive.
-BwinHome will be between 0 and 100, inclusive.


EXAMPLES

0)
3
0
100

Returns: 0

The first one to three wins will win the series. Team A is completely hopeless and always loses, so B will win this series 3:0.


1)
4
100
0

Returns: 999300007

The diametrally opposite situation to Example 0. The answer is 100^7 modulo (10^9 + 7).


2)
600
50
50

Returns: 594375906

A perfectly symmetric situation. The answer is (0.5 * 100^1199) modulo (10^9 + 7).


3)
4
53
57

Returns: 942200194


4)
7
93
87

Returns: 545426737
