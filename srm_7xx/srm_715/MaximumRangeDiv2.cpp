SRM 715 Div2 Medium (500)

PROBLEM STATEMENT
Cat Noku was given a calculator for his birthday.
The calculator is very simple.
It can only store a single variable.
The variable is called X and its initial value is 0.
The calculator has only two buttons: + and -.
Pressing + increments X by 1 and pressing - decrements X by 1.
For example, if X is 4 and Noku presses +, X is incremented to 5.

A string of '+' and '-' characters can be seen as a sequence of instructions to press the corresponding buttons.
The range of such a sequence of instructions is the difference between the largest and the smallest value stored in X while executing that sequence of instructions, in order.

For example, the range of "+++++++" is 7: the largest value of X is 7 (at the end) and the smallest value is 0 (in the beginning).
The range of "---" is 3: maximum is 0, minimum is (-3), their difference is 0 - (-3) = 3.
The range of "+-+-+-" is 1.
The range of an empty sequence of instructions is 0.

Noku's calculator came with a piece of paper that contained a string s.
Each character of s was either '+' or '-'.
Noku will choose and execute any (not necessarily contiguous) subsequence of these characters.
Help him do so in a way that maximizes the range of the executed sequence.

Compute and return the maximal range of a subsequence of the string s.


DEFINITION
Class:MaximumRangeDiv2
Method:findMax
Parameters:string
Returns:int
Method signature:int findMax(string s)


CONSTRAINTS
-s will contain between 1 and 50 characters, inclusive.
-Each element of s will be '+' or '-'.


EXAMPLES

0)
"+++++++"

Returns: 7

One optimal solution is to skip the fourth instruction (the '+' in the middle of s).
Thus, the sequence of button presses will be "+----+".
The value of X will change as follows: 0,1,0,-1,-2,-3,-2.
The maximum number we see is 1 while the minimum number is -3, so the range is 1 - (-3) = 4.


1)
"+--+--+" 

Returns: 4

One optimal solution is to skip the 4th instruction. Thus, the sequence of button presses will be "+----+". The number we see after each button press is 1,0,-1,-2,-3,-2. The maximum number we see is 1, while the minimum number is -3, so their range is 4.


2)
"++++--------" 

Returns: 8


3)
"-+-+-+-+-+-+" 

Returns: 6


4)
"+"

Returns: 1
